# Let's Find Dinner!

Let's Find Dinner! is an interactive web application developed as a project for INFO 340 at the University of Washington.
Let's Find Dinner! is made for three different groups of users within King County: consumers (food bank users), volunteers, and food banks.
The main goal of this app is to aid in centralizing food bank information for users.  

## There are three main features of Let's Find Dinner!

---

### **Food Bank Finder**
The primary feature of Let's find dinner is a search function in which users can filter for available foodbanks
by hours of operation, location, as well as specific donation requests for items that food banks need. This 
function allows for consumers to find available food banks. Volunteers and food banks are also able to interact
through the donation request filtering. 

### **Volunteer Form**
Volunteers are able to navigate to the volunteer page to submit their contact information for volunteer work. 
This can be helpful as it centralizes volunteering into one form that Let's Find Dinner could disseminate to 
food banks. 

### **Account Creation / Login**
All users are able to make a user account. Let's Find Dinner supports two different styles of accounts: one for
volunteers or consumers, and another for food banks. Both styles of accounts can be viewed in the profile page for 
individualized information per account.
